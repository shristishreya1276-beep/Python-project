Today, it's 12th of April and as I had determined that I will use this quarantine period to learn new things. I'm creating an age calculator app today using python. 
I will be updating my steps as I proceed today:
Libraries being used--
i) datetime 
ii) tkinter (used for creating GUIs using python)
iii) PIL (To insert an image)

I imported all three first. 
Next step is to create a window for our app. Window has been created, added title and geometry of the window. 
Now it's time for defining the labels. 
I defined four labels (name, year, month and date) and created a grid as well.
Now defined entry labels. And defined their grid in the next column.
Now it's time to create an input function.
